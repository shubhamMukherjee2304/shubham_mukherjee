          I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, with expertise in
          full-stack development. I’ve led and contributed to projects using technologies like React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
          Clickhouse, Redis, Kafka, Docker, and AWS. Passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning, I’m eager to apply my
          skills in roles that foster growth and development.
